# Auth0 Rules

A utility for managing actions and db script definitions on an Auth0 tenant.
Called "auth0-rules" because "Rules" were deprecated in favour of "Actions".

## Context

[CEA](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org) uses
[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to provide authentication and authorization to a
number of services (now mainly the
[EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org), and some other minor ones like
the EA Survey).

Auth0 provides a number of places where they call our code and allow us to
perform custom modifications to their default behavior, such as
[Actions](#context-on-rules), and
[Database Action Scripts](#context-on-database-action-scripts) below.

The default method of creating and editing these scripts is to use Auth0's
web-based UI. This makes it difficult to version them, and to ensure that they
are kept in sync between production, staging, and local Auth0 tenants.

This repo allows us to write our scripts in an IDE, using TypeScript, and then
automatically deploy them. üòé

### Context on Actions

When users log in, we run a number of
[Actions (part of Auth0's login pipeline)](https://auth0.com/docs/actions) that
affect the final login state (e.g. what data is present in the user's access
token or ID token, which permissions they are allowed to request etc.). From
[the docs](https://auth0.com/docs/actions):

> Actions are secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js
> that execute at certain points within the Auth0 platform. Actions are used to
> customize and extend Auth0's capabilities with custom logic.

### Context on Database Action Scripts

So long as not all of our users have logged in since we started using Auth0, we
will still need to be able to authenticate them from our local databases. We
_can't_ do this just by sending Auth0 everyone's passwords, because we don't
store passwords, we store hashes of passwords.

Example: Torble Dorp has an account on EA Funds, from 2019. He then clicks login
on the modern site, and enters his username and password into Auth0's UI. Auth0
first checks for Torble Dorp in its own database. No Torble Dorp there. So then
Auth0 calls out to our script. "Do these credentials log someone in?", it asks?
Yes. Auth0 now takes over management of Torble Dorp's account.

We write two scripts for this to happen: Login, and Get User. Get User is used
in password resets, and just takes an email as an argument. The scripts are
managed separately from Actions, but otherwise follow a lot of the same rules.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
  (`git clone https://github.com/centre-for-effective-altruism/auth0-rules.git`)
- `cd` into the directory (`cd auth0-rules`)
- Install dependencies (`yarn`)
- Build the CLI scripts and action definitions (`yarn build`)

## Usage

Sync with Auth0 using `yarn cli [actions|db|login]`

```
Usage: yarn cli actions [options] [command]

Options:
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  deploy          Deploy actions to the Auth0 tenant
  diff            Diff locally defined actions against those on the
                  Auth0 tenant
  help [command]  display help for command
```

### Commands

#### `deploy`

```sh
yarn cli [actions|db|login] deploy
```

Deploys all scripts in the manifest to Auth0.

Actions that don't match with those that are already on the Auth0 tenant will be
created, those that do will be updated. Actions that are defined on Auth0 but
that aren't in the manifest will be left alone, and will run before all Actions
that are in the manifest.

#### `diff`

```
yarn cli [actions|db|login] diff
```

Diffs locally defined scripts against those defined on the Auth0 tenant.

The output will look something like:

```
[[ Changed actions ]]
- Add Scopes to ID Token:
-------------------------
 function addScopesToIdToken(user, context, callback) {
   const requiredApplications = [
-    // Something else
+    // Giving What We Can
     "abc123def456",
   ];
   // only run if our application is on the list
   if (requiredApplications.includes(context.clientID)) {
-    const namespace = "https://parfit-staging.effectivealtruism.org";
+    const namespace = "https://parfit.effectivealtruism.org";
     context.idToken[`${namespace}/scope`] = context.accessToken.scope;
   }
   callback(null, user, context);
 }

[[ Up-to-date actions ]]
3 actions defined in the manifest are identical to those that exist on the Auth0 tenant:
- Add Default Role To All Users
- Filter scopes
- Log Context

[[ Missing actions ]]
1 actions defined in the manifest do not exist on the Auth0 tenant:
- Add email to access token

[[ Extra actions ]]
2 actions exist on the Auth0 tenant that are not included in the manifest:
- Simulate Signup Missing-Scope Issue
- auth0-account-link-extension
```

## Environment and Permissions

You'll need to ensure that the Auth0 tenant has a client application set up to
work with the CLI. The application should be a **Machine-to-Machine**
application, and needs the following permissions on the `Auth0 Management API`.

**Base permissions (required to manage actions via the API)**

- `create:actions`
- `read:actions`
- `update:actions`
- `delete:actions`
- `read:connections`
- `update:connections`

**Permissions used by specific actions**

- `read:clients`
- `read:roles`

_(Note that if you add additional scripts, for example in `getData()` calls in
the manifest, you might need to give the application additional permissions.)_

To connect to this application, the CLI expects you to have the following
variables in your shell environment. If you're developing locally, you can add
them to a `.env` file in the project root.

```
AUTH0_DOMAIN=<your Auth0 tenant domain>
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<client ID for the client application that manages the actions>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret for the above client application>
```

## Structure and compilation

This repo consists of two main folders:

- `./scripts` ‚Äì contains the actual script definitions that will run on Auth0
- `./src` ‚Äì contains the the CLI, and the manifest file that tells it which
  scripts to deploy to Auth0.

These folders are independent TypeScript projects, due to them each requiring
different compilation options.

- The action definitions are compiled as standalone `ES2020` scripts. This means
  that they will compile to Javascript that looks almost identical to the
  TypeScript source (though with type information removed)
- The CLI scripts are compiled to `ES5` Javascript, for easier consumption by
  Node.js, as Node doesn't currently support ESModules syntax (e.g. `import`).

Both the CLI and the script definitions are compiled to the `./dist` folder. You
can build both at once by running `yarn build` (which is an alias for
`yarn build:cli && yarn build:scripts`).

You can run `yarn build:scripts:watch` to have TypeScript automatically compile
actions as you are developing them. If you need to edit the CLI itself
(including the manifest file), you should also run `yarn build:cli:watch`.

## Defining Scripts

There are two steps to writing an Auth0 script:

Defining the script itself (as a file in e.g. `./scripts/actions/src`)

- [Registering the script in the manifest](#the-manifest) (`./src/manifests`)

Scripts are defined in `./scripts/[actions|db|login]/src`. Each script lives in
its own file. They are written as Typescript files (`.ts` extension).

### External dependencies

Because the actions will be executed in the context of the Auth0 WebTask
environment, they can't use imports from other files. This means that the only
`import` statements in an action definition file should be TypeScript typings.

_Note: Examples below use the now-deprecated "Rules" instead of Actions, but the
idea is the same_

```ts
// These are type definitions, which will be removed at build time by the TS compiler
// This are fine to import in your rule file
import {
  IAuth0RuleCallback,
  IAuth0RuleContext,
  IAuth0RuleUser,
} from '@tepez/auth0-rules-types'
// This will not work when run on Auth0 üö®
import { doSomething } from 'my-lib'

async function myAwesomeRule(
  user: IAuth0RuleUser<unknown, unknown>,
  context: IAuth0RuleContext,
  callback: IAuth0RuleCallback<unknown, unknown>
): Promise<void> {
  // doSomething() will not be available here üö®
  const foo = doSomething(user.id)
  // ...
  return callback(null, user, context)
}
```

It _is_ possible to use external libraries, but they need to be dynamically
`require`d at runtime. For example:

```ts
// Only type definitions imported, so we're all OK here
import {
  IAuth0RuleUser,
  IAuth0RuleContext,
  IAuth0RuleCallback,
} from '@tepez/auth0-rules-types'

async function addDefaultRole(
  user: IAuth0RuleUser<unknown, unknown>,
  context: IAuth0RuleContext,
  callback: IAuth0RuleCallback<unknown, unknown>
): Promise<void> {
  // Dynamic require works fine üëç
  const ManagementClient = require('auth0@2.31.0').ManagementClient

  const management = new ManagementClient({
    domain: auth0.domain,
    clientId: configuration.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: configuration.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
    scope: 'read:users update:users read:roles',
  })
  // ...
}
```

For a full list of modules that can be dynamically required, see the
[Auth0 Extensions 'Can I Require' tool](https://auth0-extensions.github.io/canirequire/).
Further discussion about using modules can be found
[in the Auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/action-coding-guidelines).

### Actions ordering

Actions run in series. When deployed, the actions will be ordered as follows:

- Any actions that are on the Auth0 tenant, but that aren't defined in the
  manifest will run first, in their current order
- Actions defined in the manifest will run in the order that they are defined in
  the manifest

### Templating

Sometimes, we need to inject variables that will be different on each Auth0
tenant. For example, maybe you only want an action to apply to certain
applications, so you want to use a list of these application IDs into your
function ‚Äì obviously these IDs will be different on different tenants. Instead
of hard-coding these values into the script code, you can instead inject a
`TEMPLATE_DATA` global, that will be populated by data from the `getData()`
function in the script manifest.

The `TEMPLATE_DATA` variable is declared as a TypeScript global with type
`Record<string, any>`, so the action file will compile happily. It's a good idea
to type any assignments in your action function:

```ts
function myGreatFunction() {
  const whitelist: string[] = TEMPLATE_DATA.whitelist
  // ... do stuff
}
```

When scripts are compiled, any action that has a `getData()` property on its
manifest will inject a `TEMPLATE_DATA` variable into the top of the function
declaration:

```js
function myGreatFunction() {
  // Template data
  const TEMPLATE_DATA = {
    whitelist: ['abc123def456'],
  }

  const whitelist = TEMPLATE_DATA.whitelist
  // ... do stuff
}
```

You can use any data type for the value of the keys in `TEMPLATE_DATA`. Values
are passed to `JSON.stringify()` for injection into the code.

#### Templating helpers

**`getCommentValue()`**

Injecting values is all well and good, but a simple list of random object IDs is
difficult to read. If you have an array of IDs and you want to include
additional data for better readability, you can use the `getCommentValue()`
function to build your array of input data.

`getCommentValue()` takes a single argument, which is an object that has a
`value` property. If you pass an array of these objects as a property of
`TEMPLATE_DATA`, it will be mapped into an array of just the values in each
object's respective `value` property.

So, instead of ...

```ts
const TEMPLATE_DATA = {
  whitelist: ['abc', 'def'],
}
```

... you instead see:

```ts
const TEMPLATE_DATA = {
  whitelist: [
    {
      name: 'Something descriptive',
      value: 'abc',
    },
    {
      name: 'Another item',
      value: 'def',
    },
  ].map((item) => item.value),
}
```

See the example below for a full demonstration of how this works end-to-end.

#### Templating example

Action definition (e.g. `./actions/add-default-roles.ts`).

```ts
import type { ManagementClient } from 'auth0'
import {
  DefaultPostLoginApi,
  DefaultPostLoginEvent,
} from '../types/auth0-actions'

const auth0Sdk = require('auth0')

exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (
  event: DefaultPostLoginEvent,
  api: DefaultPostLoginApi
) => {
  try {
    const DEFAULT_ROLES: string[] = TEMPLATE_DATA.defaultRoles

    const ManagementClient = auth0Sdk.ManagementClient
    const management: ManagementClient = new ManagementClient({
      domain: event.secrets.AUTH0_DOMAIN,
      clientId: event.secrets.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: event.secrets.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
      scope: 'read:users update:users read:roles',
    })

    const params = { id: event.user.user_id }
    const data = { roles: DEFAULT_ROLES }

    // If the user is brand new there's no way that they have that role applied,
    // so we always add the roles
    if (event.stats!.logins_count === 0) {
      await management.users.assignRoles(params, data)
      return
    }

    // Otherwise we need to check the roles currently assigned to the user
    const roles = await management.users.getRoles({ id: event.user.user_id })
    const roleIds = roles.data.map((role: { id: string }) => role.id)

    if (!DEFAULT_ROLES.every((defaultRole) => roleIds.includes(defaultRole))) {
      await management.users.assignRoles(params, data)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // @ts-ignore `error` is assumed to have type `unknown`, when actually it will always be an `Error`. Casting isn't sufficient because the types annotations are dropped in the deployed version
    api.access.deny(`Failed to set default role: ${error?.message}`)
  }
}
```

Manifest entry:

```ts
export const ACTION_MANIFEST: ActionDefinition[] = [
  ...
  {
    name: 'Add Default Role To All Users',
    file: 'add-default-roles',
    enabled: true,
    trigger: 'post-login',
    triggerVersion: 'v3',
    getData: async () => {
      const defaultRoleNames = [
        'User-Basic-Role',
        'Parfit User',
        'EA Funds User',
        'Giving What We Can User',
      ]
      const Roles = await getAllRoles()
      const defaultRoles = Roles.filter(isValidRole)
        .filter((Role) => defaultRoleNames.includes(Role.name))
        .map((Role) => getCommentValue({ value: Role.id, roleName: Role.name }))
      return { defaultRoles }
    },
  },
  ...
]
```

The `getData` call will return the following object:

```js
{
  defaultRoles: [
    {
      applicationName: 'EA Forum',
      value: [
        'User-Basic-Role',
        'Parfit User',
        'EA Funds User',
        'Giving What We Can User',
      ],
    },
  ].map((item) => item.value),
}
```

Which will be compiled into the following action code:

```ts
import type { ManagementClient } from 'auth0'
import {
  DefaultPostLoginApi,
  DefaultPostLoginEvent,
} from '../types/auth0-actions'

const auth0Sdk = require('auth0')

const TEMPLATE_DATA = {
  defaultRoles: [
    'User-Basic-Role',
    'Parfit User',
    'EA Funds User',
    'Giving What We Can User',
  ].map((item) => item.value),
}

exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (
  event: DefaultPostLoginEvent,
  api: DefaultPostLoginApi
) => {
  try {
    const DEFAULT_ROLES: string[] = TEMPLATE_DATA.defaultRoles

    const ManagementClient = auth0Sdk.ManagementClient
    const management: ManagementClient = new ManagementClient({
      domain: event.secrets.AUTH0_DOMAIN,
      clientId: event.secrets.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: event.secrets.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
      scope: 'read:users update:users read:roles',
    })

    const params = { id: event.user.user_id }
    const data = { roles: DEFAULT_ROLES }

    // If the user is brand new there's no way that they have that role applied,
    // so we always add the roles
    if (event.stats!.logins_count === 0) {
      await management.users.assignRoles(params, data)
      return
    }

    // Otherwise we need to check the roles currently assigned to the user
    const roles = await management.users.getRoles({ id: event.user.user_id })
    const roleIds = roles.data.map((role: { id: string }) => role.id)

    if (!DEFAULT_ROLES.every((defaultRole) => roleIds.includes(defaultRole))) {
      await management.users.assignRoles(params, data)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // @ts-ignore `error` is assumed to have type `unknown`, when actually it will always be an `Error`. Casting isn't sufficient because the types annotations are dropped in the deployed version
    api.access.deny(`Failed to set default role: ${error?.message}`)
  }
}
```

## Running Database Action Scripts against a local dev environment

If you want to test an updated Database Action Script you might wonder how to do
so when you're local database isn't exactly easy to hit from Auth0's servers. It
might be more trouble than it's worth and you should just test on staging.
However it is not impossible to test locally.

First, make sure you have [Packet Riot](https://packetriot.com/) installed
(`brew install packetriot`). You'll need a paid plan.

Next, set up two TCP ports to forward to your local databases.

```
pktriot tunnel tcp allocate
pktriot tunnel tcp forward --destination 127.0.0.1 --dstport 5432 --port 22996
```

Where 5432 is the postgres port number, and 22996 is the port number it randomly
generated after the first command.

Then you'll need to update the connection environment variables in the Auth0 UI
to reflect your packet riot host.

### A note on the development connection name

You can technically have more than one database of Auth0 usernames and
passwords. It's pretty rare that you'd actually want to do so however. In our
case, we were faced with an issue where the original database (called
Username-Password-Authentication, like the others), was not set up with user
migration enabled, and Auth0 strangely did not allow for us to enable it after
the fact. So we use 'Forum-User-Migration', which was created specially for
testing the ability to migrate Forum users.

To use this connection in your application, you'll need to update your
application in the Auth0 UI, where you can select which connection it uses for
username and password authentication.

## Automatic deploys

We use GitHub actions to auto-deploy these actions to the relevant Auth0 tenant
when merging to `master` or `dev`.

To check that deployment worked, check the workflow run of
[Gitub Actions](https://github.com/centre-for-effective-altruism/auth0-rules/actions)
and verify that the diffs are as expected.
