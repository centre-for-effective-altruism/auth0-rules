/**
 * 1. Filters the scopes available on a user's access token, based on the
 * application they are using to log in.
 * 2. Adds the requested scopes to the `idToken` so they are readable by applications
 *
 * 1. Filtering scopes:
 *
 * For applications on the whitelist, all scopes are allowed. Otherwise, the
 * rule only allows a restricted subset. This makes it easy for third party
 * applications to use our Auth0 system for authentication, without allowing
 * them to authorize resources that shouldn't be accessible outside of
 * first-party applications.
 *
 * Because we're manually editing the `accessToken.scopes` property, Auth0 will
 * no longer check that the user actually has the permissions that they are
 * requesting. Instead, we need to use the Management Client to get the
 * permissions attached to the user, and only include the union of <allowed
 * permissions> and <requested permissions> in the access token.
 *
 * 2. Adding scopes to id token
 *
 * Single Page Applications don't have an easy way to inspect which scopes are
 * present on the Access Token. The Access Token should be treated as an opaque
 * string (even though it's technically possible to decode it if it's a JWT).
 * Instead, we should place any data that's supposed to be accessible to the
 * application into the ID Token.
 *
 * We restrict this to the subset of applications that are in fact SPA's, as
 * other applications may use cookies to store Auth0 sessions, and adding a lot
 * of scopes to the ID Token (which will also by necessity be added to the
 * Access Token) will significantly increase cookie size (which may cause failed
 * HTTP requests â€“ total HTTP headers should be smaller than 8kb).
